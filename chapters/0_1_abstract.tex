This thesis addresses the validation of automatically generated Simulation-Based Digital Twins (SBDTs) within discrete material flow systems. While learning SBDTs from data promises reduced creation and updating efforts, these benefits are negated if Verification, Validation, and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) require manual expert involvement. To overcome this, a multi-layered, automated VVUQ framework is developed and empirically validated. This framework integrates data processing using Object-Centric Event Logs, twin synchronization, and ML-based validation using a novel supervised classification approach. Results from an IoT Factory case study demonstrate that a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-based classifier effectively identifies statistically significant discrepancies between real and simulated process data. Permutation testing confirms these findings across multiple SBDT components (process flow, resource allocation, time models), revealing specific areas where the current SBDT configuration lacked fidelity in the case study. The framework enables continuous, automated validation, offering a scalable and objective alternative to periodic manual checks and providing feedback for targeted SBDT improvement. While requiring initial infrastructure setup efforts, the methodology contributes a practical approach for enhancing SBDT reliability and trustworthiness in manufacturing.

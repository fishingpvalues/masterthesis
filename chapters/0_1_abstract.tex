This thesis investigates the application of Digital Twins within discrete material flow systems, a key component of Industry 4.0. It reviews the progression from Digital Models and Digital Shadows to fully realized Digital Twins that integrate real-time data, simulation, and control mechanisms. While DTs promise enhanced monitoring, predictive analytics, and operational control in manufacturing, their automated generation poses challenges in terms of accuracy, overfitting, and real-time performance. To address these challenges, this research proposes a data-driven framework for automated verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification of simulation-based DTs. Leveraging object-centric event logs and advanced machine learning techniques, the framework aims to seamlessly integrate digital simulation with real-world data. This approach not only improves decision support in dynamic manufacturing settings but also ensures that the resulting DTs maintain high fidelity and robustness by continuously benchmarking their performance against operational metrics. The framework is evaluated via a comprehensive case study examining its effectiveness in enhancing process efficiency and predictive precision.

This thesis investigates the application of Digital Twins within discrete material flow systems, a key component of Industry 4.0. It reviews the progression from Digital Models and Digital Shadows to fully realized Digital Twins that integrate real-time data, simulation, and control mechanisms. To learn these Digital Twins from data enables companies to reduce twin creation and updating efforts. These gained advantages would be made obsolete if the validation and verification of such twins were performed manually involving experts. To address this problem, this research proposes a data-driven framework for automated verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification of simulation-based digital twins. Leveraging object-centric event logs and advanced machine learning techniques, the framework aims to seamlessly integrate digital simulation with real-world data. This approach ensures that the resulting Digital Twins maintain high fidelity and robustness by continuously benchmarking their performance against operational metrics. The framework is evaluated via a comprehensive case study examining its effectiveness in enhancing process efficiency and predictive precision.

\chapter{Framework Design}
\label{chap:methodology}
This chapter develops the methodological approach for automatically performing VVUQ for automatically generated SBDT in the manufacturing domain. The foundational methodology uses data-driven frameworks and applies ML tecniques to verify and validate the SBDT. The following chapter structure derives requirements besides the identified key requirements given in \autoref{sec:requirements-automatically-generated-models}, categorizes them and presents a conceptual blueprint. It is based on the theoretical findings from Chapter \ref{chap:theory} and designed to ensure that the VVUQ process is systematic, reproducible, and adaptable to different use cases.

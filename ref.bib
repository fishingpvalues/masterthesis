@article{conformance,
 abstract = {Abstract Process mining techniques use event data to discover process models, to check the conformance of predefined process models, and to extend such models with information about bottlenecks, decisions, and resource usage. These techniques are driven by observed events rather than hand-made models. Event logs are used to learn and enrich process models. By replaying history using the model, it is possible to establish a precise relationship between events and model elements. This relationship can be used to check conformance and to analyze performance. For example, it is possible to diagnose deviations from the modeled behavior. The severity of each deviation can be quantified. Moreover, the relationship established during replay and the timestamps in the event log can be combined to show bottlenecks. These examples illustrate the importance of maintaining a proper alignment between event log and process model. Therefore, we elaborate on the realization of such alignments and their application to conformance checking and performance analysis. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

With various sensors built into each module and the computational capacities of the Data-Analytics Cluster of the CfADS, the IoT-Factory reveals a wide field of new methods to answer the latest research questions. The modular composition allows for stand-alone operation of each module, facilitating simultaneous studies of different issues. The system enables autonomous production without human intervention, requiring personnel only for specific tasks such as restocking. A circulatory process can be implemented, allowing for the reversal of assembly to disassembly, storing components for future tasks.},

@article{Ishaq_Bhatti2014,
 abstract = {The concept of performance management is used by most of the organizations to ensure that either they are going on the right path or not. For managing the performance, the organizations are required to know about the performance indicators. This paper explores the key performance indicators (KPIs) and the impact of these KPIs on the overall organizational performance in the manufacturing sector in Pakistan. The data for the present study was collected from the top-level management of the 84 best manufacturing organizations in Pakistan by using a structured questionnaire, and the impact of KPIs on the overall performance of the manufacturing organizations was evaluated. The results show that the manufacturing organizations put more focus on customer satisfaction and delivery reliability in terms of performance measurement. Measuring the performance in terms of cost, financial, quality, time, flexibility, delivery reliability, safety, customer satisfaction, employees’ satisfaction, and social performance indicators has a positive significant impact on the overall organization’s performance. This paper puts together all important performance indicators used by organizations in a single list and checks their impact on the overall performance indicator index of the organizations. As Pakistan is among the developing countries, this study will serve as a valuable guideline for several manufacturing organizations operating in other developing countries of the world.},

The paper also provides a guideline for conceptualizing technology resistance away from the common existing conceptualization that is shaped through theories of adoption and resistance-to-change. The goal is to encourage future research to conceptualize technology resistance beyond the typical findings available in the literature and provide more insights in light of the provided arguments and suggestions.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

 abstract = {A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object or process capable of collecting information from the real environment to represent, validate and simulate the physical twin’s present and future behaviour. It is a key enabler of data-driven decision making, complex systems monitoring, product validation and simulation and object lifecycle management. As an emergent technology, its widespread implementation is increasing in several domains such as industrial, automotive, medicine, smart cities, etc. The objective of this systematic literature review is to present a comprehensive view on the DT technology and its implementation challenges and limits in the most relevant domains and applications in engineering and beyond.},

 abstract = {While eco-balances and Material Flow Networks are common analysis tools of Environmental Management Information Systems (EMIS), discrete event simulation has not been used widely for this purpose. This paper argues in favour of combining discrete event simulation with material flow analysis to explore both the environmental and economic impact of business decisions. After a brief overview of core characteristics and benefits of discrete event simulation and material flow analysis using Material Flow Networks, a plug-in architecture for generating customized material flow simulators is presented. The benefits of this framework's component-based structure are then discussed in terms of its practical application to the lithography stage of the semiconductor manufacturing process. A summary of the framework's most significant characteristics and areas of application concludes the paper.},

The paper also provides a guideline for conceptualizing technology resistance away from the common existing conceptualization that is shaped through theories of adoption and resistance-to-change. The goal is to encourage future research to conceptualize technology resistance beyond the typical findings available in the literature and provide more insights in light of the provided arguments and suggestions.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

It is a key enabler of data-driven decision making, complex systems monitoring, product validation and simulation and object lifecycle management. As an emergent technology, its widespread implementation is increasing in several domains such as industrial, automotive, medicine, smart cities, etc. The objective of this systematic literature review is to present a comprehensive view on the DT technology and its implementation challenges and limits in the most relevant domains and applications in engineering and beyond.},
